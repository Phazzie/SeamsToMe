/**
 * Quality Agent Stub
 *
 * Purpose: Checks code/docs for quality issues and generates quality reports.
 * Data Flow: Receives code/doc input, outputs quality report.
 * Integration: Invoked by orchestrator; may call other agents for context.
 *
 * SDD: Minimal stub implementing contract, with mock returns for all methods.
