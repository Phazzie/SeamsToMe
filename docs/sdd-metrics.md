# SDD Metrics: Measuring Seam Effectiveness

This document outlines metrics and approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of seams in an SDD-based system. These metrics help teams identify issues, refine seams, and quantify the benefits of the SDD approach.

## Core Seam Health Metrics

### 1. Stability Metrics

- **Contract Change Frequency**: How often a seam's contract changes

  - Target: Low frequency (ideally < once per quarter for mature seams)
  - Measurement: Track contract version history

- **Breaking Change Rate**: Percentage of contract changes that are breaking vs. non-breaking

  - Target: < 10% of changes should be breaking
  - Measurement: Track via Changelog Agent

- **Backward Compatibility Duration**: How long deprecated contract versions are supported
  - Target: Minimum 3 months for critical seams
  - Measurement: Track via Contract Registry

### 2. Quality Metrics

- **Contract Violation Rate**: How often runtime data violates contract expectations

  - Target: < 0.1% of calls
  - Measurement: Runtime validation logging

- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of seam contract requirements covered by tests

  - Target: 95%+ for critical seams
  - Measurement: Specialized seam test coverage tools

- **Documentation Completeness**: Percentage of seam attributes fully documented
  - Target: 100% for active seams
  - Measurement: Documentation checklist audit

### 3. Performance Metrics

- **Seam Latency**: Time taken for operations across a seam

  - Target: Define per seam based on criticality
  - Measurement: Runtime monitoring

- **Error Rate**: Percentage of seam operations resulting in errors

  - Target: < 1% for stable seams
  - Measurement: Error logging

- **Retry Rate**: How often operations need to be retried
  - Target: < 5% of calls
  - Measurement: Retry counter logging

## AI-Specific SDD Metrics

### 1. AI Development Effectiveness

- **AI Generation Accuracy**: How accurately AI implements against contracts

  - Target: 90%+ compliance with first generation
  - Measurement: Contract conformance test pass rate on AI-generated code

- **Context Window Efficiency**: How effectively contracts fit into AI context windows

  - Target: Complete contracts should use < 30% of available context
  - Measurement: Token count analysis

- **Human Intervention Rate**: How often human developers must fix AI-generated implementations
  - Target: Decreasing trend over time
  - Measurement: Code review tracking

### 2. "70% Wall" Breakthrough Metrics

- **Implementation Completion Rate**: Percentage of a project completed with AI assistance

  - Target: 90%+ (breaking through the "70% Wall")
  - Measurement: Project milestone tracking

- **Integration Issue Density**: Number of integration issues per 1000 lines of code

  - Target: 50% fewer than non-SDD projects
  - Measurement: Issue tracking categorized by type

- **Time-to-Integration**: Time from component implementation to successful integration
  - Target: 75% faster than non-SDD approaches
  - Measurement: Development timeline analysis

## Process Metrics

### 1. SDD Conformance

- **Contract-First Adherence**: Percentage of components with contracts before implementation

  - Target: 100%
  - Measurement: Artifact creation timestamps

- **Stub Coverage**: Percentage of contracts with corresponding stubs

  - Target: 100%
  - Measurement: Artifact inventory

- **Seam Test First Ratio**: Percentage of seams with tests before full implementation
  - Target: 90%+
  - Measurement: Commit history analysis

### 2. Team Effectiveness

- **Time Spent Debugging Integration**: Hours spent on integration issues

  - Target: Decreasing trend, 75% less than non-SDD projects
  - Measurement: Time tracking

- **Onboarding Time**: Time for new developers to make meaningful contributions

  - Target: 50% faster than non-SDD projects
  - Measurement: First PR time tracking

- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: Number of blocked tasks due to seam issues
  - Target: Decreasing trend
  - Measurement: Project management metrics

### 3. Cognitive Load Metrics

These metrics specifically measure how SDD reduces mental burden, particularly for non-traditional developers or those heavily relying on AI:

- **Contract Comprehension Time**: How long it takes a new developer to understand a contract

  - Target: <15 minutes per contract for properly designed seams
  - Measurement: Developer onboarding tracking

- **Localization Speed**: How quickly developers can locate the source of an issue

  - Target: 75% of issues localized to specific seam within 30 minutes
  - Measurement: Issue resolution time tracking

- **Context Switch Overhead**: Time spent re-familiarizing with code when moving between components

  - Target: Reduced by 50% compared to non-SDD projects
  - Measurement: Developer time tracking and surveys

- **Prompt Engineering Efficiency**: How effectively contracts translate to AI prompts

  - Target: Contract-based prompts should achieve 40%+ better results than ad-hoc prompts
  - Measurement: AI output quality scoring against requirements

- **Architectural Comprehension Growth**: Rate at which non-traditional developers improve in architectural thinking

  - Target: Demonstrable improvement within 3 months of using SDD
  - Measurement: Architecture design exercise benchmarks

- **Interface vs. Implementation Ratio**: Balance between time spent defining interfaces vs. implementations
  - Target: 30-40% on interfaces, 60-70% on implementations for optimal cognitive distribution
  - Measurement: Time tracking categories
