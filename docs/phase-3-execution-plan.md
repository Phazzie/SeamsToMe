# Phase 3 Execution Plan: Systematic Seam Test Completion

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a methodical approach to complete Phase 3 of SDD (All Seam Tests Passing) with proper understanding and architectural integrity. The goal is NOT to make tests pass superficially, but to ensure our seam contracts are correctly defined and our stubs properly implement those contracts.

## Current State Analysis

**Test Status**: 36 failed, 71 passed, 107 total tests
**SDD Phase**: Phase 3 - All Seam Tests Passing
**Critical Principle**: We are validating seam contracts, NOT implementing business logic

## Phase 3 Methodology: What Are We Actually Testing?

### Understanding Seam Tests

Seam tests validate:

1. **Contract Adherence**: Do stubs return `ContractResult<T>` with proper structure?
2. **Interface Compliance**: Do method signatures match contracts exactly?
3. **Error Handling**: Do stubs handle invalid inputs with proper `ErrorCategory`?
4. **Integration Points**: Can agents be registered/discovered through orchestrator?

### What We Are NOT Testing

- Business logic implementation
- Data persistence
- Complex algorithms
- Performance optimization

## Systematic Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Diagnostic Analysis (1-2 hours)

#### 1.1 Test Categorization

```bash
npx jest --listTests --json > test-inventory.json
npx jest --passWithNoTests --verbose 2>&1 | tee test-results-full.log
```

**Categorize failures by type**:

- **Contract Pattern Issues**: `result.success` vs `result.result` access patterns
- **Error Category Mismatches**: Wrong `ErrorCategory` enum values
- **Type Mismatches**: Parameter types not matching contract interfaces
- **Integration Failures**: Orchestrator registration/communication issues
- **Stub Logic Errors**: Stubs not implementing minimal contract requirements

#### 1.2 Failure Root Cause Analysis

For each failing test suite:

1. Read the test file completely
2. Identify what contract behavior is being validated
3. Check if the failure is:
   - Contract definition issue
   - Stub implementation issue
   - Test expectation issue
   - Integration wiring issue

### Step 2: Contract Validation Pass (2-3 hours)

#### 2.1 Contract Consistency Audit

**Goal**: Ensure all contracts follow identical patterns

**Checklist per contract**:

- [ ] All methods return `Promise<ContractResult<T, AgentError>>`
- [ ] Input types are properly exported and imported
- [ ] Output types are properly exported and imported
- [ ] Error categories are consistently used
- [ ] Contract interface is properly exported

**Action**: Fix any contract inconsistencies BEFORE touching stubs

#### 2.2 Type System Validation

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --strict
```

**Goal**: Zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Step 3: Stub Implementation Audit (3-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Stub Compliance Verification

For each agent stub, verify:

**Required Stub Behavior**:

```typescript
// Stubs should follow this pattern
async methodName(input: InputType): Promise<ContractResult<OutputType, AgentError>> {
  try {
    // Minimal validation
    if (!input || invalid_basic_check) {
      return failure(createAgentError(
        'agent-id',
        'Description of validation failure',
        ErrorCategory.INVALID_REQUEST, // Correct category
        'ValidationError'
      ));
    }

    // Minimal stub response (not business logic)
    return success({
      // Minimal valid response structure
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return failure(createAgentError(
      'agent-id',
      `Unexpected error: ${error.message}`,
      ErrorCategory.INTERNAL_ERROR,
      'UnexpectedError'
    ));
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Stub Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Returns proper `ContractResult<T>` structure
- [ ] Handles null/undefined inputs gracefully
- [ ] Uses correct `ErrorCategory` values
- [ ] Provides minimal valid output structure
- [ ] Includes proper error handling with try-catch
- [ ] Uses `createAgentError` with correct parameter order

### Step 4: Test Expectation Validation (2-3 hours)

#### 4.1 Test Logic Review

For each failing test:

**Verify test expectations are appropriate for stubs**:

- Tests should validate contract adherence, not business outcomes
- Tests should check `result.success` boolean
- Tests should validate error categories for invalid inputs
- Tests should NOT expect complex business logic

**Example of GOOD stub test**:

```typescript
it("should return success with valid input", async () => {
  const result = await agent.methodName(validInput);
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  expect(result.result).toBeDefined();
  expect(typeof result.result.requiredField).toBe("string");
});

it("should return failure with invalid input", async () => {
  const result = await agent.methodName(null);
  expect(result.success).toBe(false);
  expect(result.error?.category).toBe(ErrorCategory.INVALID_REQUEST);
});
```

**Example of BAD stub test**:

```typescript
it("should perform complex business calculation", async () => {
  // This expects business logic, not appropriate for stub phase
});
```

### Step 5: Integration Seam Validation (2-3 hours)

#### 5.1 Orchestrator Registration Tests

**Goal**: Verify agents can be registered and discovered

**Test Pattern**:

```typescript
it("should register agent successfully", async () => {
  const result = await orchestrator.registerAgent("agent-id", ["capability1"]);
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
});

it("should route tasks to registered agents", async () => {
  // Register agent first
  await orchestrator.registerAgent("agent-id", ["capability1"]);

  // Submit basic task
  const taskResult = await orchestrator.submitTask({
    agentId: "agent-id",
    action: "basicAction",
    parameters: validInput,
  });

  expect(taskResult.success).toBe(true);
});
```

#### 5.2 Agent Communication Seams

Verify each agent can:

- Be instantiated without errors
- Be registered with orchestrator
- Receive and respond to basic task requests
- Return proper error responses for invalid requests

## Execution Schedule

### Day 1: Analysis & Planning

- **Morning**: Complete diagnostic analysis (Step 1)
- **Afternoon**: Contract validation pass (Step 2)
- **Output**: Categorized list of issues with root causes

### Day 2: Contract & Stub Fixes

- **Morning**: Fix contract inconsistencies
- **Afternoon**: Fix stub implementation issues
- **Output**: All stubs properly implement contracts

### Day 3: Test & Integration Validation

- **Morning**: Validate and fix test expectations (Step 4)
- **Afternoon**: Integration seam validation (Step 5)
- **Output**: All seam tests passing

## Quality Gates

### Before Moving to Each Step

- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Clear understanding of what each failing test is validating
- [ ] Root cause identified (not just symptoms)

### Before Completing Phase 3

- [ ] 100% test suite passing
- [ ] All contracts follow identical patterns
- [ ] All stubs implement minimal contract requirements
- [ ] All integration seams validated
- [ ] Zero business logic implemented in stubs
- [ ] Documentation updated with lessons learned

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Symptom Fixing**: Changing test expectations instead of fixing root causes
2. **Business Logic Creep**: Implementing real functionality in stubs
3. **Pattern Inconsistency**: Different error handling patterns across agents
4. **Integration Shortcuts**: Hardcoding responses instead of proper seam validation

### Validation Checkpoints

After each major fix:

1. Run full test suite
2. Verify TypeScript compilation
3. Check that fix doesn't break other tests
4. Confirm fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- 107/107 tests passing
- 0 TypeScript compilation errors
- All contracts follow identical patterns
- All stubs implement minimal requirements

### Process Metrics

- Clear documentation of each fix and its reasoning
- No business logic implemented in stub phase
- Proper SDD phase discipline maintained
- Foundation ready for Phase 4 (business logic implementation)

## Documentation Requirements

### For Each Major Fix

Document:

1. **What was failing**: Specific test and error
2. **Root cause**: Why it was failing
3. **Fix applied**: What was changed
4. **Validation**: How we confirmed the fix

### Phase 3 Completion Report

- Summary of all issues found and resolved
- Lessons learned about contract design
- Recommendations for Phase 4 implementation
- Updated test patterns and standards

## Next Phase Readiness

### Phase 4 Prerequisites

- All seam tests passing (Phase 3 complete)
- Clear understanding of each agent's contract
- Established patterns for error handling
- Integration seams validated and working
- No business logic in stubs (clean slate for implementation)

**Critical Success Factor**: When Phase 3 is complete, we should have a robust foundation where any developer can implement business logic for any agent with confidence that the integration patterns work correctly.
