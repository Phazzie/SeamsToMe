:/. **Implement Support for Template Variations/Sets (Simple Version):** - [ ] Update `mvpSddScaffolder.contract.ts`: Add optional `templateSet?: string` to `MVPSddScaffoldRequest`. - [ ] Update `mvpSddScaffolder.agent.ts`: Implement logic to look for templates in subdirectories based on `templateSet`, with fallback to default. - [ ] Update `mvpSddScaffolder.contract.test.ts`: Add tests for template variations. - [ ] Update `mvpSddScaffolder.integration.test.ts`: Add integration tests for template variations. - [ ] Update documentation.

### Step 6.2: Develop SeemsToMe_CLI_Orchestrator (`seems_to_me_cli.py`)

- **Purpose:** To provide a command-line interface for interacting with core "SeemsToMe" agents, starting with the `MVPSddScaffolderAgent`.

1.  [x] Initial Python script `seems_to_me_cli.py` created with `argparse` for `scaffold` subcommand.
2.  [ ] Define and implement robust invocation strategy for calling the Node.js-based `MVPSddScaffolderAgent` from Python (e.g., via a compiled JS entry point or a dedicated runner script).
3.  [ ] Test CLI interaction with `MVPSddScaffolderAgent` for all `SddComponentType` options.
4.  [ ] Implement error handling and user-friendly output in the CLI.
5.  [ ] Document CLI usage in `README.md` or a dedicated CLI guide.

## Implementation Priority

If resources are constrained, consider implementing the agents in this suggested order:

1. Seam Analyzer Agent (helps identify additional seams)
2. Stub/Scaffolding Agent (helps create additional stubs)
3. Prompt Generator Agent (helps with AI-assisted implementation)
4. PRD/Design Doc Generator Agent (helps with requirements)
5. Quality Agent (helps maintain system quality)
6. AI Pair Programmer Agent (helps with implementation)
7. API Doc Reader Agent (helps with external integrations)
8. Refactoring Assistant Agent (helps improve existing code)

This priority order focuses on agents that provide the most leverage for implementing other agents.

## Metrics & Progress Tracking

Track the following metrics during implementation:

- **Contract Completion**: Number of contracts defined / total planned
- **Stub Completion**: Number of stubs implemented / total planned
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of contract methods with tests
- **Documentation Completeness**: Number of agents with documentation / total planned

Update this document as tasks are completed to maintain an accurate progress record.
