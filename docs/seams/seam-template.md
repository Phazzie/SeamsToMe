# Seam/Contract Design Document Template

## Seam Name

(Descriptive name, e.g., "Orchestrator-KnowledgeAgent Seam")

**Seam ID / Contract File**: [`path/to/your.contract.ts`](../../src/contracts/your.contract.ts) <!-- Link to the actual contract file -->
**Version**: [v1.0.0] <!-- Corresponds to Contract Version in the .contract.ts file -->
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Status**: [DRAFT|ACTIVE|DEPRECATED|RETIRED]

## Purpose

Describe what this seam/interface is for and why it exists. Include:

- The problem it solves or the interaction it enables.
- Why it exists as a separate, defined seam.
- Design Rationale for this Seam: Key reasons for defining this boundary and its specific design.
- Alternatives considered (if any significant ones).

## Participants

List the primary agents or components that interact via this seam.

| Participant Name | Role (e.g., Caller/Consumer, Implementer/Provider) | Direction of Primary Data Flow |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [AgentName1]     | [Role]                                             | [IN/OUT/BOTH]                  |
| [AgentName2]     | [Role]                                             | [IN/OUT/BOTH]                  |

## Data Structures & Formats

- Define the primary data types, interfaces, and request/response structures used. **Link to definitions in the corresponding `.contract.ts` file or `src/contracts/types.ts`.**
- Include key validation rules and constraints not immediately obvious from type definitions.
- Note any specific serialization/deserialization considerations if applicable (usually handled by runtime, but note if special).

## Expected Behaviors & Guarantees

- List the key functional behaviors, guarantees, and expectations for this seam.
- Document idempotency characteristics if applicable.
- Note any significant side effects of invoking methods on this seam.
- Include performance expectations (e.g., typical latency, throughput considerations) if critical.

## Error Handling

- This seam utilizes the standard `ContractResult<TOutput, AgentError>` pattern defined in `src/contracts/types.ts`.
- Refer to `AgentError` and `ErrorCategory` in `src/contracts/types.ts` for common error structures.
- Document any specific error conditions or `ErrorCategory` values particularly relevant to this seam.
- Specify retry policies or fallback behaviors expected from consumers or provided by implementers, if any.

## Versioning & Change Management

- Versioning strategy: Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) as reflected in the contract file header and this document.
- Backward compatibility: Minor and Patch versions MUST be backward compatible. Major versions MAY introduce breaking changes.
- Breaking change policy: Document process for introducing and communicating breaking changes (e.g., major version bump, deprecation warnings).
- Deprecation process: Outline how and when parts of the seam might be deprecated.

## Seam Health & Monitoring (Conceptual)

Considerations for observing the health of interactions across this seam:

- Potential for monitoring success/failure rates of calls.
- Observing latency patterns.
- Tracking contract violations (e.g., malformed requests/responses, though type system helps).

## Testing Requirements

- **Contract Conformance Tests**: Implementations of this contract MUST be verified by tests located in `src/tests/contract-name.contract.test.ts`.
- Key scenarios and edge cases to be covered by these tests.
- Performance testing considerations if applicable.

(Use this template for each significant seam, typically corresponding to a `*.contract.ts` file, in the `/docs/seams/` folder.)
