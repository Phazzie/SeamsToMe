# SDD Monitoring and Observability

This document outlines strategies and practices for monitoring Seam-Driven Development (SDD) systems in production environments. Effective monitoring is essential for maintaining seam health, detecting contract violations, and ensuring system robustness.

## Monitoring Philosophy for SDD Systems

SDD systems require a specialized monitoring approach that focuses on:

1. **Seam-Level Observability**: Monitoring the health and behavior of seams rather than just individual components
2. **Contract Conformance**: Ensuring runtime data continues to adhere to contract definitions
3. **Integration Health**: Detecting issues at integration points before they cascade through the system
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Monitoring fallback behavior activation and effectiveness

## Key Monitoring Points in SDD Systems

### 1. Seam Transaction Monitoring

- **Data Flow Tracing**: Track data as it flows across seam boundaries
- **Contract Validation**: Validate that data crossing seams conforms to contracts
- **Transaction Volume**: Monitor call frequency and patterns between components
- **Cross-Seam Correlation**: Link related operations across multiple seams using correlation IDs

### 2. Contract Conformance Monitoring

- **Schema Validation**: Runtime validation of data against contract schemas
- **Behavioral Conformance**: Verify that component behavior matches contract expectations
- **Error Contract Adherence**: Ensure errors follow defined patterns and protocols
- **Version Compatibility**: Monitor for mismatches in contract versioning

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- **Seam Latency**: Measure time taken for operations across seams
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage at seam boundaries
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify seams that constrain overall system performance
- **AI Operation Metrics**: Special focus on performance of AI-powered components

### 4. Error and Resilience Monitoring

- **Error Rates per Seam**: Track error frequency at each seam boundary
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: Monitor the state of circuit breakers protecting components
- **Retry Patterns**: Track retry attempts and success rates
- **Fallback Activation**: Monitor when and how often fallback strategies are triggered
- **Recovery Time**: Measure how quickly components recover from failure states

## Implementing SDD Monitoring

### Instrumentation Approaches

1. **Decorator Pattern**: Wrap seam interactions with monitoring code

   ```typescript
   // Example: Monitoring decorator for a seam
   function withSeamMonitoring<T>(
     seamName: string,
     operation: () => Promise<T>
   ): Promise<T> {
     const startTime = performance.now();
     const correlationId = generateCorrelationId();

     metrics.incrementCounter(`${seamName}.calls`);

     try {
       const result = await operation();

       // Validate result against contract if possible
       const isValid = validateAgainstContract(seamName, result);
       if (!isValid) {
         metrics.incrementCounter(`${seamName}.contract_violations`);
       }

       metrics.incrementCounter(`${seamName}.successes`);
       metrics.recordTiming(
         `${seamName}.latency`,
         performance.now() - startTime
       );

       return result;
     } catch (error) {
       metrics.incrementCounter(`${seamName}.errors`);
       metrics.recordEvent(`${seamName}.error`, {
         correlationId,
         errorType: error.name,
         message: error.message,
       });
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Aspect-Oriented Monitoring**: Use AOP techniques to monitor seams without modifying code
3. **Service Mesh Integration**: Leverage service mesh capabilities for microservice-based systems
4. **Log Augmentation**: Enhance logging with seam-specific context and correlation IDs

### Seam Dashboards

Effective SDD monitoring requires specialized dashboards focusing on:

1. **System Topology View**: Visualization of all seams and their current health status
2. **Contract Compliance**: Dashboard showing contract violation rates and patterns
3. **Seam Health Metrics**: Traffic light indicators for each seam's health
4. **Error Correlation**: Visualization of error propagation across seams
5. **AI Component Performance**: Special dashboards for AI-powered components

Example dashboard layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ SEAM HEALTH OVERVIEW            │  │ CONTRACT COMPLIANCE             │
│                                 │  │                                 │
│ [Component A] ──🟢── [Component B] │  │ Contract A-B: 99.8% Compliant    │

└─────────────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## SDD Alerting Strategy

Effective alerting should focus on:

1. **Contract Violations**: Alert on recurring contract violations above threshold
2. **Seam Degradation**: Alert when seam performance degrades beyond baseline
3. **Cascading Failures**: Early detection of failure propagation across seams
4. **Circuit Breaker Triggers**: Alert when circuit breakers open repeatedly
5. **Version Mismatch**: Alert when components use incompatible contract versions

Alert priority should be based on:

- Impact on overall system integrity
- Number of affected downstream components
- Availability of fallback mechanisms
- Business criticality of affected functionality

## Special Considerations for AI Components

AI-powered components in SDD systems require additional monitoring:

1. **Prompt-Result Correlation**: Track which prompts lead to contract violations
2. **Token Usage Monitoring**: Track token consumption for cost management
3. **AI Latency Patterns**: Monitor for changes in AI component response times
4. **Human Intervention Rates**: Track how often human fallbacks are triggered
5. **Model Drift Detection**: Identify when AI outputs start to drift from expected patterns

## Integration with SeemsToMe

The SeemsToMe project should incorporate:

1. **Monitoring Agent**: A specialized agent for runtime monitoring of SDD systems
2. **Alerting Rules Engine**: Configurable rules for SDD-specific alerting
3. **Health Visualization**: Interactive topology map showing seam health
4. **Contract Validation Service**: Runtime validation of data against contracts
5. **Correlation ID Manager**: Tool for tracing operations across seams

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor at the Seam, Not Just Components**: Focus on interactions, not just internal metrics
2. **Validate Against Contracts**: Use contract definitions as monitoring validation rules
3. **Track Correlation IDs**: Use unique IDs to follow transactions across seams
4. **Baseline Normal Behavior**: Establish performance and error rate baselines for each seam
5. **Test Monitoring in Chaos**: Verify monitoring during chaos engineering exercises
6. **Alert on Trends, Not Just Thresholds**: Detect gradual degradation in seam health
7. **Record Before/After for Contract Violations**: Capture data before and after it crosses problematic seams
