# SeemsToMe Contract IDE Feature Specification

## Overview

The Contract IDE is a specialized editor and toolset within SeemsToMe that facilitates the creation, management, visualization, and evolution of contracts/seams. This feature aims to make SDD contract-first development more intuitive and efficient.

## Purpose

- Provide a purpose-built environment for defining and managing contracts
- Enforce SDD best practices through tooling
- Visualize seam relationships and health
- Streamline contract versioning and evolution

## Key Features

### 1. Contract Editor

- Syntax highlighting specialized for contracts
- Auto-completion for common contract patterns
- Real-time validation of contract syntax and structure
- Blueprint comment templates and prompts
- Semantic code navigation specific to contracts

### 2. Contract Visualization

- Interactive graph of contracts/seams and their relationships
- Color-coding to show contract health and status
- Drill-down capability to view contract details
- Multiple view options (dependency view, agent view, temporal view)
- Export to various formats (SVG, PNG, interactive HTML)

### 3. Contract Registry

- Centralized repository of all contracts
- Metadata tracking (owner, version, status, etc.)
- Search and filter capabilities
- Version history and diff visualization
- Contract dependency tracking

### 4. Contract Evolution & Versioning

- Semantic versioning enforcement
- Change impact analysis
- Breaking change detection
- Backward compatibility validation
- Migration path planning assistance
- Deprecation scheduling and notification

### 5. Contract Health Metrics

- Visualization of metrics defined in SDD-metrics.md
- Stability scoring for each contract
- Change frequency tracking
- Integration with test results
- Custom metric definition

### 6. Contract Validation & Testing

- Test generation for contract conformance
- Validation against schema
- Mock generation for testing
- Integration with testing framework
- Coverage visualization

## Integration with Other SeemsToMe Components

### Agent Integration

- **Contract Agent**: Primary owner of the Contract IDE
- **Knowledge Agent**: Stores rationale and evolution history
- **Changelog Agent**: Records contract changes
- **Quality Agent**: Validates contracts against best practices
- **Orchestrator**: Enforces contract-first workflow

### Workflow Integration

1. User/AI defines contract requirements
2. Contract IDE generates initial contract draft
3. Contract is reviewed and refined
4. Tests are generated and validated
5. Contract is published to registry
6. Implementations reference the contract
7. Contract evolution is managed through the IDE

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

- VS Code extension or web component
- Integration with version control
- Database for contract registry
- Graph visualization engine
- Metrics collection and analysis service

### User Experience

- Intuitive, modern interface
- Context-sensitive help and guidance
- Integration with VS Code themes
- Customizable views and layouts
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## AI Assistance Features

- Contract generation from natural language descriptions
- Suggestion of improvements to contracts
- Automatic detection of potential issues
- Blueprint comment generation
- Learning from existing contracts to suggest patterns

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Contract Editor

- Basic editor with syntax highlighting
- Simple visualization of contracts
- Initial contract registry

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing

- Contract validation
- Test generation
- Health metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- AI assistance
- Complex visualizations
- Full evolution management

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in time to create contracts
- Improvement in contract quality (measured by violations)
- Increased adherence to SDD principles
- Faster onboarding of new developers to SDD
- Breaking through the "70% Wall" in more projects
